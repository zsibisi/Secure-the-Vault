# Secure-the-Vault
Block 7 Workshop

Here is the discription of this project.

we are building a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes in a combination. Using the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three variables. Each variable will be the result of each calculation (three in total). The combination of the lock is 10 - 40 - 39. we must use three different arithmetic operators that will generate each individual number, then display the combination on the HTML page, or in an alert popup.

Requirements;
1. Before anything else, I wrote the pseudocode of your steps and how to solve this exercise.
2. Created a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:.
3. Assigned three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator(+-*/). Each must equal one of the three  codes in the combination.
4. Added comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process.
5. Created a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text.
